## Building
You can just run `lein uberjar` to produce an executable jar file, containing everything necessary. You can then run it with `java -jar`.
If you install the [lein-bin](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-bin) plugin, then running `lein bin` will produce a truly executable jar,
under the name `pts`, that can be run without specifying the Java executable.
